# Boston House Prices Analysis/Neural Network Project

## This is a Jupyter notebook that analyses the Boston Housing dataset.

It compares the median values of housing with regard to whether or not they are near or far from the Charles River (CHAS). It runs some descriptive to find the mean, max, median, standard deviation and variance . 

The variables are explored using line plots and boxplot to understand more about the data. It also uses inferential statistics on the dataset, running Student's TTest and ANOVA to find any differenes in the means of the data. 

It then uses the Keras Neural Network to (try to) make accurate predictions about the target variable, using the CHAS as the target variable.



## How to use this notebook

you can clone the repository to your local machine using:

```shell
git clone 
```

To run the notebook, you must first install Jupyter Notebooks. It is recommended that you install the package manager Anaconda, which comes bundled with Python 3 and Jupyter.
The guide to installing Anaconda is [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
A guide is [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

To run the notebook, open a terminal or bash window and type:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will automatically open the Jupyter file directory GUI in your browser at localhost:8888. From here you can open the boston-house-prices-analysis.ipynb file.
When the notebook opens, click on cell > run all to run all cells.
