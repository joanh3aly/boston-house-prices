# Boston House Prices Analysis/Neural Network Project

Initial plan - 

Describe (Good summary of the dataset, repository well laid-out and organised. Reasonable commits to the repository):
- Download dataset
- Run basic analysis of dataset - df.head, find mean, max, min, median, variance etc
- Plot the data using matplotlib/seaborn (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ianmcloughlin/jupyter-teaching-notebooks/blob/master/simple-linear-regression.ipynb)

Infer (Appropriate analysis of the relationship between the me- dian house price and whether the house borders the river, with good explanations of the analysis)
- Investigate locations of houses, find patterns.
- Find median (analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t)

Predict (Well-trained neural network providing decent predictions of house prices based on the other variables. Good explanations of how to use the neural network and how it works)
- Use keras [7] to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.
