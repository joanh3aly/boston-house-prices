    "(20%) Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a jupyter [6] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices [1] dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Good summary of the dataset, repository well laid-out and organised. Reasonable commits to the repository.*\n",
    "\n",
    "(20%) Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should explain and discuss your findings within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Appropriate analysis of the relationship between the me- dian house price and whether the house borders the river, with good explanations of the analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "(60%) Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras [7] to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish — for example, you may use all the other variables, or select a subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Well-trained neural network providing decent predictions of house prices based on the other variables. Good explanations of how to use the neural network and how it works.*\n",
